# Internacionalizacao
Internationalization of app in Android Studio.
<br>
<br>
App implemented to study about Internationalization of app. When the user change the OS Android Language, the app change automatically and if the language is not implemented on the app, it change to default language implemented.<br><br>
In this example I used (English US, Portuguese BR and Persian). The English is the default language.<br><br>
This example was used to learn and practice programming techniques in Android Studio in my postgraduate course at UTFPR(Universidade Tecnológica Federal do Paraná).<br><br>
